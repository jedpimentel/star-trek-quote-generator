This is a simple quote generator that's styled to look like a Star Trek TOS PADD

User can go through quotes randomly. Statistically, I've included enough quotes that at least half of users will see at least 10 quotes before starting to see repeats. 

All the quotes are hardcoded into the JavaScript, and where taken from the "Memory Alpha" Star Trek wiki.

Started as part of the freecodecamp.com curriculum.

The Star Treck style font is called "Roddenberry", via Pixel Sagas Freeware Fonts.
