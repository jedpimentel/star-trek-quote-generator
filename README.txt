This is a simple quote generator that's styled to look like a Star Trek TOS PADD

User can go through quotes randomly. I've included fifty nine quotes. Statistically, most users will see 10 quotes before starting to see repeats. All the quotes are hardcoded into the JavaScript, and were taken from the "Memory Alpha" Star Trek wiki.

To do:
	Replace px measuments with em.
	Give the picture area a background texture and improve the image stretching.
